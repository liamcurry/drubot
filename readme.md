# Drubot

Drubot is my attempt to learn Go by creating a very simple IRC bot, with plugin
support.

## Plugins

Plugins allow users to give commands to the bot. Commands can be sent to the
bot using `drubot image robots`, or with the shorter syntax `!i robots`.

## TODO

- SSL
- Unit tests
- More configuration options
- Multiple server support
- Enable/disable plugins with a command
